# Welcome

The purpose of this document is to introduce novices to computer programming.  Programming concepts are introduced slowly through this interactive document (an Apple Playground).

## Feedback

This is very much a work in progress, and I'd appreciate your feedback: hollarab@gmail.com

# Learning to program: Introduction

## Swift

Swift is a new programming language from Apple for iOS and OSX development.  
It was released to the public in the summer of 2014, and was in development at Apple for a few years prior to that.  
Swift 2.0 was released a month ago, and 2.1 is on it's way.

## Exciting Times!

The [TIOBE Oct 2015 Report](http://www.tiobe.com/index.php/content/paperinfo/tpci/index.html) on the popularity of programming language, open likes this:

> October Headline: Ruby replaces Objective-C in TIOBE index top 10
>
> It was a matter of time. Soon after Apple announced to switch from Objective-C to Swift, 
> Objective-C went into free fall. This month Objective-C dropped out of the TIOBE index 
> top 10. Scripting language Ruby exploited this drop and entered the top 10 again. 
> Ruby's small revival is a bit surprising.

Objective C went from **3rd** in Oct 2014 to **14th** in Oct 2015

Swift moved from 19th to 15th in the same time.


## Apple's Playgrounds and Xcode

This file in an Apple **Playground**, and you're viewing it in **Xcode 7**.  

Playgrounds allow you to write Swift code, and get feedback immediately, like this:

print("Hello world!")

Xcode is an *Interactive Development Environment* (IDE): a tool software developers use to write and debug software.  *Almost all* iOS and OSX apps are written in Xcode.

## Today's agenda


We will step through this document, page by page.

I'll talk over a concept, adding color commentary to the Playground.





## Look / Fix / Write

We have 10 exercises we'll go through: 0 through 9.  

Each will have **Look**, **Fix** and **Write** sections.

You will:
* *Look* at an example of working code.
* *Fix* a piece of code with an error.
* *Write* code from scratch to solve a problem.


## Navigation
Before we go on, it helps to have the Navigator panel open (on the left).
- `CMD + 0` - Show / Hide Navigator
