# Welcome

This is a Swift Playground, a new feature of Xcode 6.  These playgrounds mix **text** with **live code** to create a immersive learning experience.


## Feedback

This is very much a work in progress, and I'd appreciate your feedback: hollarab@gmail.com

# Learning to program: Introduction

The purpose of this document is to introduce novices to computer programming.  Programming concepts are introduced slowly through this interactive document (an Apple Playground).

## Swift

Swift is a new programming language from Apple for iOS and OSX development.  It was released to the public in the summer of 2014, and was in development at Apple for a few years prior to that.  Swift is still evolving and changing, but is clearly the future of writing software for Apple's hardware.

## Apple's Playgrounds and Xcode

This file in an Apple **Playground**, and you're viewing it in **Xcode**.  Playgrounds allow you to write Swift code, and get feedback immediately, like this:

```swift
print("Hello world!")
```

Xcode is an *Interactive Development Environment* (IDE): a tool software developers use to write and debug software.  Most iOS and OSX apps are written in Xcode.


Today's agenda

Look / Fix / Write

Look together.  You fix.  I fix.  You write. I write.
