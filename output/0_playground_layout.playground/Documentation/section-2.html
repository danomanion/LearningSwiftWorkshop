    <p>And on the far right, you should see: <code class="code-voice">Howdy!  I&#39;ve live code!</code> which is the output of this line of code.</p>
<p>If you change the contents of <strong>any</strong> live code section, all the code sections will be re-calculated.</p>
<p>So: <em>if you have an error anywhere in your code, it has to be fixed or none of it will run</em>.</p>
<h3 id="look-fix-write">Look / Fix / Write</h3>
<p>To aid in learning the skill of programming and the Swift programming language, these playgrounds get you <em>into the code</em> quickly.  Concepts are introduced in text, then you&#39;re guided through three levels of activities to see the code in action.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Look</strong> An example of said concept working in code (an example of syntax).</li>
<li><strong>Fix</strong> A (commented out) broken code snippet that you must fix.</li>
<li><strong>Write</strong> Using the examples previous, write the code yourself.</li>
</ul>
<p>Let&#39;s see that in action:</p>
<div class="look-block">
    <span class="title">Look: Comments</span>
    <p>Comments are parts of the source code that are ignored at runtime.  They exist for us lowly humans.</p>
