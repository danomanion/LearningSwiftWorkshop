# Programming terminology

*Computer program* : series of written instructions that tell a computer what to do.

*Programming language* : a complete set of rules (instructions) that one may write a computer program in.  We write code in a given programming language.

*Object Oriented Programming* : a model of software development that breaks code into functional units, called objects.

*Compiler* : in Swift (and other languages), the compiler transforms the code you write, into something the computer can run.

*Swift* : a programming language that allows you to write computer programs for iPhone, iPad and OSX machines.

*Syntax* : the rules of how to write valid statements (code) in a given programming language.

*Reserved Words* : words the syntax does not allow you to use.  In Swift <code class="code-voice">let</code>, <code class="code-voice">var</code>, <code class="code-voice">true</code>, <code class="code-voice">false</code> are all examples. 

*Syntax error* : an misuse of the syntax, which is caught quickly by Xcode.  A Swift program with a syntax error will not compile and therefore will not run.

*Semantic error* : code has correct syntax, but does the wrong thing (including crashing).

*Debugging* : the act of removing errors from a computer program.

*Statement* : a single piece of code.




## Collections
Swift provides two *collection* types: <code class="code-voice">Array</code> and <code class="code-voice"><Dictionary/code>.
