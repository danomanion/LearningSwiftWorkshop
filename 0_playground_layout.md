# Welcome

This is a Swift Playground, a new feature of Xcode 6.  These playgrounds mix **text** with **live code** to create a immersive learning experience.


## Feedback

This is very much a work in progress, and I'd appreciate your feedback: hollarab@gmail.com

## Formats and Conventions

### Code Snippets

Code snippets (things you would type) can be presented <code class="code-voice">inline, like this</code> or in

<div class="code-block">
a block like this
</div>

After this, uses of this highlighting is to aid in finding snippets to type in.

For example, type <code class="code-voice">println("Hello World!")</code> bellow

### Live Code
You'll notice the **live code** sections start at the far lefthave line numbers at the left, like this:

```swift
println("Howdy!  I've live code!")
```

And on the far right, you should see: <code class="code-voice">Howdy!  I've live code!</code> which is the output of this line of code.

If you change the contents of **any** live code section, all the code sections will be re-calculated.

So: *if you have an error anywhere in your code, it has to be fixed or none of it will run*.

### Look / Fix / Write

To aid in learning the skill of programming and the Swift programming language, these playgrounds get you *into the code* quickly.  Concepts are introduced in text, then you're guided through three levels of activities to see the code in action.

 - **Look** An example of said concept working in code (an example of syntax).
 - **Fix** A (commented out) broken code snippet that you must fix.
 - **Write** Using the examples previous, write the code yourself.

Let's see that in action:

<div class="look-block">
	<span class="title">Look: Comments</span>
	<p>Comments are parts of the source code that are ignored at runtime.  They exist for us lowly humans.</p>
</div>

```swift
// Double forward slash '//' comments out the rest of that line

println("i'm working!") // single-line comments don't have to start the line

/*
 This is a comment that spans many lines.

 any code in here will be ignored.
 */

```

Once we see the new behavior, in this case Comments, we'll have to fix an example.

<div class="fix-block">
	<span class="title">Fix: Comments</span>
	<p>Oh noes!  Not all of the below code should be commented out!  Fix the snippet so it's clear who the best is. </p>
</div>

```swift
/* I'm gonna tell everyone who the best is!
println("I'm the best")
*/
```

Fixing broken code always feels good, and with Playgrounds you get instant feedback and know when it's fixed.  Hopefully more confident, we move on to writting our own code.

<div class="write-block">
	<span class="title">Write: Comments</span>
	<p>Learning what you learned above, insert 4 lines of commented text below showing all the valid syntax.</p>
</div>

```swift




```

### Extra Credit

For those that want to reach a little farther, additional write instructions will periodically appear.  If working through this multiple times, maybe you skip these on the first pass.

<div class="extra-block">
	<span class="title">Extra Credit: Comments</span>
	<p>Come on now, how am I gonna think of extra credit around comments?</p>
	<p>You'll have to go through the **real** Playgrounds to see some Extra Credit. </p>
</div>
